        Singapore to the World
      </h3>
      <p>
        South-East Asia is a region with incredible flavours and culinary diversity. However,
        while certain South-East Asian cuisines, such as Thai, have become popular globally,
        most have yet to truly break through to the wider world.
        Singaporean cuisine, with its Chinese, Malay, and Indian influences (amongst others),
        is one that we believe has the potential to excite food lovers all across the globe.
        At Sinkies, we hope to serve Singaporean food to the best of our abilities and help
        the cuisine gain greater recognition and appreciation.

       Restaurants mean many things to different people. A restaurant is a magical place where
        friends catch up, families spend time together, and couples make memories. By striving to
        welcome all parties with attentiveness, sincerity, and respect, we hope to create the bit
        of magic that you are looking for.
