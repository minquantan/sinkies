        Singapore to the World
      </h3>
      <p>
        The region that Singapore is situated in, South-East Asia, is home to incredible
        cuisines and flavours. While a few South East Asian cuisines, such as Thai, have
        become popular globally, others have yet to truly break through to the wider world.
        Singaporean cuisine, with its Chinese, Malay, and Indian influences (amongst others),
        is one that we believe has the potential to excite food lovers all across the globe.
        At Sinkies, we hope to serve Singaporean food to the best of our abilities and help
        the cuisine gain greater recognition and appreciation.
